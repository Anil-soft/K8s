üî• Common Reasons for ImagePullBackOff Error
1Ô∏è‚É£ Incorrect Image Name or Tag
If the image name is incorrect or the tag does not exist in the registry, Kubernetes fails to pull the image.
Fix:
Check available image tags in the registry.
Correct the image name and tag in the Deployment YAML.

Command to verify:
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n namespace

2Ô∏è‚É£ Image Does Not Exist in the Registry
If the image is removed or never existed in the repository, Kubernetes fails to pull it.

Command to check if the image exists:
docker pull <image-name>:<tag>

If this fails, update your manifest file with the correct image.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Authentication Issues for Private Registry
If the image is stored in a private registry (AWS ECR, Docker Hub, GCR), Kubernetes needs authentication to pull it.

Check if credentials are missing:
kubectl get secret

If the required secret is missing, create one.
Fix: Create a secret for registry authentication

kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred \
  --docker-server=<registry-url> \
  --docker-username=<username> \
  --docker-password=<password> \
  --docker-email=<email>

Add the secret to your pod spec:
spec:
  imagePullSecrets:
    - name: regcred

4Ô∏è‚É£ Insufficient Node Resources
If the node does not have enough disk space or memory, the image cannot be pulled.

Check available disk space on nodes:
kubectl describe node <node-name>

Check running pods consuming resources:
kubectl top pod 

Fix:
Delete unused pods to free up space.
Resize the node or increase disk storage.
